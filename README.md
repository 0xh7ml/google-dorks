## Operators
#### Search Term

This operator searches only for the exact term inside the quotation marks. You can use this for example if the term you are looking for is ambiguous and could easily be confused with something else, or if you don't get enough relevant results. 

Here is an example:

```
"Admin Loginpage"
```

#### OR
This operator searches for a specific search term OR another term.

```
site:instagram.com | site:github.com
```

#### AND
This operator searches for a specific search term and another term.

```
site:github.com & site:twitter.com
```

#### Operators combinaison
This operator combines search terms 
```
(site:instagram.com | site:twitter.com) (intext:"admin")
(site:instagram.com | site:twitter.com) & intext:"admin"
```

#### Include results

This will order results by the number of occurrence of the keyword.

```
-site:twitter.com +site:twitter.*
```

#### Exclude results

```
site:twitter.* -site:twitter.com
```

### Better Results (Subdomains)
```
site:*.site.com

site:*.*.site.com

site:*.*.*.site.com
```
#### Synonyms

```
~set
```

#### Glob pattern (*)

```
site:*.com
```
